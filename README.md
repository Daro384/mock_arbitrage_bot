Arbitrage App

What Is Arbitrage?
Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price. It exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms.

What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet.

Our app will be doing a comparison of at least two different crypto marketplaces of a certain “Chain” in our application currently it is Ethereum and all of its “coins” that are related using its logic. What we are trying to accomplish is taking that information from one marketplace and comparing it to another and whichever “coin” has the highest arbitrage value will be put at the top of a list and be marked in green. If there is no profit or loss it will simply be gray, and if there’s a loss when making the trade it will be marked red. We will have 3 client-side routings, an Home page which is all of the coins loaded onto a list, Top 10 page which is the top 10 most arbitrage value of all time, and Coin page that describes with more information and more details on arbitrage opportunities with that coin. 

User stories
Our users will be able to open up our application/website and will be greeted with a full list of possible arbitrage transitions using cryptocurrency, it will sort them based on highest profit margin. If our user only wants to look at the top 10 then they can click on the button to view only the top 10 most profitable of all time. As well as if our user wants to learn more about a certain coin they can click on the coin page and read up on that.
